(Note: I can't help on that topic but WebXR is good solution for some VR project because you can publish without publishing and so bypass le store blockage at the cost of having user kowing you exists.) 

# 0 : Lynx a hope in the rise of the Open Community

OK so OpenXR, just a reminder that all this API exist and are different:
- Steam VR API
- Oculus API
- Microsoft MR API
- Sony PS API
- WebXR API
- Alternative VR API
- Phone Gryo API

But... you also have AR
- ARkit API
- ARCore API
- ...

- Mark VS Stan



What will happen when AR Glass will arrive on the market from several company at the same time

So Open XR... What is it ?
And why I think the Lynx through it company is a game changer.

# 0: Disclaimer: It makes 10 years that I have a food in the undustrie but it makes 2 years I did not touch VR.
- COVID yes but mainly because Meta
- Mark Lock Down: 3-5 weeks review before publishing
- Be accepted don't means beeing publish you are add to calendar
- You can't publish something that is not MVP and you still have 2-4 weeks review and can be refused
- I tried to work 7j/7 on WMR but realized that we need an OS or at least a perfect screen resolution to do that.

But then ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20149493/175124900-6752cd95-5fb7-434b-b5ba-7bd92e3d2da8.png)

# 8 Call to action: It is a good moment to re-start on VR.

- Micro oled
- AR Passtrhough
- Open XR that start to be ready
- Oculus Quest "3" with I hope will provide 3D mesh of the room and Color AR passthrough
- Unity Input System that allows abstraction on the industry for most application
- ECS and Job system that allows multithreading
- Question
- I will spend all next year on Lynx so feel free to sent me contact or ask question at anytime on the subject.
