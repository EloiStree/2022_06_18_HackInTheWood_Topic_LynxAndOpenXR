> If like me you need to study for the N time how to use VR with Unity, you are at the right place. Let's see how OpenXR works.

Every now and then Unity and the VR industry change the way you interface your game with the devices. 
With COVID 19, I stopped having VR project but with the Lynx-R1 coming soon. I need to relearn the basic.
