  - Unity Package a good way to split and avoid spaghetti code.

(Note: I can't help on that topic but WebXR is good solution for some VR project because you can publish without publishing and so bypass le store blockage at the cost of having user kowing you exists.) 

# 0 : Lynx a hope in the rise of the Open Community

OK so OpenXR, just a reminder that all this API exist and are different:
- Steam VR API
- Oculus API
- Microsoft MR API
- Sony PS API
- WebXR API
- Alternative VR API
- Phone Gryo API

But... you also have AR
- ARkit API
- ARCore API
- ...

What will happen when AR Glass will arrive on the market from several company at the same time

So Open XR... What is it ?
And why I think the Lynx through it company is a game changer.

# 6: What we know won't changed

For variable you can use Unity System, yours or Rewired. 
For local point in space you can use Transform.

- Head & Center Eyes
- Controller Position (Warning on rotation)
- Root of the tracked Zone (event if lot's of way to do it it can be resume to one Transform point)
- A l'exception du Guardian(s) swap
- The ground, floor and wall ingame "detection"
- Oculus vs Ultar Leap vs Manus&Others vs Hololens vs Myo
- Finger of the hands
- Blurry zone of the hands wrist
- Ultra leap and arms tracked
- Vocal : Audio > Service (online ou offline) > Group of words
- " Vocal plus: Alexa, Facebook Ai ... >string and context "
- Spectrum of Voice: Training > Pattern > String Event (with start and end)
- EEG technology : NextMind  API > String Event + String State
- Future ?
- "Eyes Tracking ? Origine and destination"
- Oculus AI  based on camera in the Quest and outside the Quest #ViveOrigin
- "Body part track anchor points" Kinect and Open CV ?
- Mesh Around and in front ?
- Compute Shader & Job System vs Mesh or API 
- Sub topic: Kinect challenge of 512x420 = 215040 points (on phone it is a lot)
- AI Image Recognition service ? String words Cloud.

#7: Unity Package and Quarantine Zone

One of my best way to avoid interdependance is to use the Unity Package System to create walls between project that should not be connected by really want to be linked.

- Assembly in Unity
- Package in Unity
- Joint Package
- Demo Package #F**kOculusIntegreation
